The 5th and 4th, with more variables, are better than the first 3. This could be because 3PA is a rather important influence on FG%, which makes models 4 and 5 better. It seems 3PA and Pos aren't really affected by or affect FT%, which makes the 5ht model better, but I don't really know why that is."
